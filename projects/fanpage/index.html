            <h3>Vinne's Work</h3>

            <p>
                As mentioned before a lot of Vinne's work is composed of well thoughtout details and it's no suprise that 
                there are some who would want their own copy of it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Like many other digital artists, Vinne has a variety of ways one can obtain some form of merch. 
                He has his own apperal shop were he's incorporated some of his art in. Some of his illustrations are
                also avaibale as prints. 
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the lastest projects Vinne's has been working on is NFTS. What's unique about this project is that
                it's a combination between clothing and illustrations. The project consists of a series of character illustrations 
                with a unique set of clothing, and once an individual purchases th NFT, they will also obtain the actual clothing item 
                their character is wearing.

            <h3>Personal Encounter</h3>
            <p>I found vinne.art through Instagram and was one of the first digital artists I ever followed. During this time I was getting really into digital art and illustrations, and was instantly drawn to his work.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure how to describe his work in sentences, but if I were to describe it in words it would be: vaporwave, cyber/grunge, & techware.</p>
                
            <p>Not only was I drawn to the art style but I really admired the amount of detail put into the characters clothes. 
                I love when artists can incorporate fashion into their illustrations because not only does it give the piece much more meaning, but its also very inspirational.</p>
                
            <p>Though my digital art skills aren’t as near, I really hope one day my art can be as unique as his.</p>
